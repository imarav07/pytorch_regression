# Neural Network Regression Project with PyTorch

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive PyTorch project designed to tackle a regression problem using a neural network. It provides a step-by-step implementation covering the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data generation and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and model interpretation.

The project is structured to be both an executable example and a detailed educational resource, explaining the "why" and "how" behind each phase of building a robust neural network regression model.
